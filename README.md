# Improtek improvisation software

ImproteK is a system dedicated to human-computer music improvisation guided by a "scenario" (harmonic progression, composed scenario using a user-defined alphabet,...)

ImproteK 5.0 (research prototype) contains :
1) generative processes in a modular CommonLisp library to use in the OpenMusic environment

2) an audio interface (in Max) dedicated to live performance
